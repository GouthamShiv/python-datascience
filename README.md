# python-datascience

repo for maintaining all the learning materials created from taking up the Udemy course - https://www.udemy.com/share/105SgA3@jI016OcdF_0R0lxYJT6TEdh_AYDGo_bcYlUkUmb1PeZ0qo5aF_OTZuTwInR99EoM/

# Complete `Python` & `Data Science` Course for Absolute Beginners

This so called **project**, is actually all the learnings that I have managed to accumulate by taking up the course [Complete Python & Data Science Course for Absolute Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/share/105SgA3@b-b-i62y90RM-qVQ1oFaGTDOzAIVgeitblk8UJn4046Yj2Jh4zAiMDznhiZyy9kp/) from `Udemy` _no idea if this is an affiliated link!_

I might have tossed up a few materials here and there, from other places which I found to be useful related to `Python` that are not covered as part of the above mentioned course.
